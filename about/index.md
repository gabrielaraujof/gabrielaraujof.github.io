Hello! I am Gabriel and I live in Aracaju, Brazil. I am a software developer, tech enthusiast and currently a substitute professor at Federal University of Sergipe. I love programming, tv-series, soccer, basketball, and *some* nerd stuff --- of course those items come after my beloved girlfriend.

### Quick facts about me

- I ran away from home when I was 3 years old.
- In seventh grade, my challenge in life was to take tests with an extra question.
- I never had a video game console --- poor me!
- I was 17 when my father bought our very first computer.
- And just six months later it was my first day in Computer Science college.
- When I'm focused on doing something, I just can't stop until it's done.
- I have never traveled abroad, although I always dreamed about it.

### Educational background and technical skills

I graduated in computer science with focus on machine learning. In the last ~5 years I've been involved with speech recognition research (specially for the brazilian portuguese language). I am master in computer science with minor in intelligent computing and proficient in Java and Python programming. Currently, I teach programming and theory of computation and I am interested in smart and cross-plataform applications.
